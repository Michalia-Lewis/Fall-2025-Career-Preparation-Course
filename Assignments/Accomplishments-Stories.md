# 🌟 Accomplishment Stories and Grids Worksheet

## 📚 Story 1:

After my first year of teaching in Japan, our textbooks were updated with new content that focused on global awareness. As a result, my sixth-grade students struggled to understand these difficult topics in English. To help them, I created a game on baamboozle.com that not only helped with vocabulary review but also with speaking practice. Throughout the game, Baamboozle offers multiple “power-ups” so that students could win regardless of their English ability, while also rewarding them when they do well. This helped improve overall morale and made the students understand and use the topics at hand without the help of me or the homeroom teacher.

### ⭐ Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR):

**S:** Students were struggling to understand difficult topics in English.  
**T:** Help them understand and enjoy the topics they were learning about.  
**A:** Using Baamboozle.com I created a game that allowed students to study the topics in a fun way.  
**R:** Students were able to understand and use the topics without assistance. Engagement in English even with difficult topics also improved.

## 📚 Story 2:

In my role as a quality specialist at Walgreens Co., I monitored new hire calls to ensure they followed standard operating procedures (SOPs) while providing an efficient and pleasant customer experience. I identified strengths and areas for improvement during these calls and conducted coaching sessions to enhance their call control, handling times, service quality, and effective use of SOPs. During these sessions, I provided constructive feedback by reviewing their previous calls, helping them recognize their own challenges and prepare for similar situations in the future. I also had them listen to high-scoring calls and asked them to identify what stood out and how they could apply it to future calls. As a result of these sessions, the new hires I supported saw at least 30% improvement in their call scores and customer satisfaction ratings.

### ⭐ STAR Breakdown:

**S:** Call monitoring for new hires to check for quality assurance.  
**T:** Assess new hires' calls and identify areas for improvement.  
**A:** Delivered feedback sessions using call reviews and guided self-assessment.  
**R:** Measurable 30% improvement in scores and satisfaction.

## 📚 Story 3:

During my undergraduate internship, I designed a layout for a large health screening event that met COVID-19 safety regulations while ensuring efficiency. To achieve this, I put in place measures like floor signs for social distancing, individual pens for participants, and sanitizing stations between each participant. We also gave out a symptoms questionnaire and checked body temperatures to minimize COVID-19 transmission risk. I created a floor plan to organize each station for maximum efficiency, following these guidelines. To evaluate my planning, I conducted a survey to gather feedback from participants. Of the 91 attendees, 59 completed an evaluation survey with eight questions. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with 98% rating the layout and flow a 5 out of 5, and 98% rating their overall experience similarly. Additionally, 85% of respondents indicated a 10 out of 10 likelihood of participating in future screenings, showing that the event design successfully balanced safety, efficiency, and participant satisfaction.

### ⭐ STAR Breakdown:

**S:** Planned a health screening event at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
**T:** Ensure the health screening followed COVID-19 regulations while still providing a pleasant participant experience.  
**A:** Designed floor signs and layouts to ensure social distancing, and implemented sanitation measures and wellness checks to decrease transmission risk.  
**R:** 98% of the 59 survey respondents rated the layout and flow a 5 out of 5, and 85% indicated a 10 out of 10 likelihood of participating in future screenings.
